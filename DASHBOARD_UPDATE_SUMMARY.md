## Calculations

### Points
```
Points = (Recyclable + Organic) × 10 + Entries × 5
```

### Level
```
Level = Points ÷ 250 + 1
```

### CO₂ Savings
```
CO₂ = (Recyclable + Organic) × 2 kg
```

### Trees
```
Trees = CO₂ ÷ 21 (annual absorption)
```

## Example

**If you enter:**
- General: 10 kg
- Recyclable: 5 kg
- Organic: 8 kg
- Entries: 15

**You'll see:**
- Total Entries: 15
- Recycling Rate: 56.5%
- Points: 205
- Level: 1
- Waste Recycled: 13 kg
- CO₂ Saved: 26 kg
- Trees: 1
