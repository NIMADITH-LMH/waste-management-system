## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't access frontend
**Solution**: Frontend is now on port 3001 (not 3000)
- URL: http://localhost:3001

### Issue: Login not working
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend is running (http://localhost:5000)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify you registered with correct credentials

### Issue: MongoDB errors
**Solution**: 
- Connection is working! ✅
- If issues arise, check Network Access in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure IP is whitelisted

### Issue: Email/SMS warnings in console
**Solution**: 
- This is normal - services are not configured yet
- The app will work without them
- Configure later in `.env` file if needed
