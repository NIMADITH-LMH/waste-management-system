- Organic Waste (kg & %)
- Non-Recyclable Waste (kg & %)
- Hazardous Waste (kg & %)

### Environmental Impact
- CO2 Emissions Saved (kg)
- Trees Equivalent (number)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```javascript
const [isGeneratingReport, setIsGeneratingReport] = useState(false);
const user = useAuthStore((state) => state.user);
```

### Key Functions

#### 1. `generateCSVReport()`

- Reuses generateHTMLReport logic

### Data Calculations
All reports use the same calculation functions as dashboard:
- `calculatePoints()` - Gamification points
- `calculateLevel()` - User level
- `calculateCO2Saved()` - Environmental impact
- `calculateTreesEquivalent()` - Trees saved
