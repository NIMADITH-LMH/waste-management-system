---

## üîß Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add Routes to App.jsx

Find your main `App.jsx` or routing file and add these routes:

```javascript
import SustainabilityManagerDashboard from './pages/sustainability-manager/SustainabilityManagerDashboard';

// Inside your Routes
<Route 
  path="/sustainability-manager/*" 
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute roles={['sustainability_manager', 'admin']}>
      <SustainabilityManagerDashboard />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } 
/>
```

The dashboard handles its own sub-routes internally:
- `/sustainability-manager` - Redirects to list
- `/sustainability-manager/plastic-suggestions` - List all suggestions (with edit/delete)
- `/sustainability-manager/plastic-suggestions/create` - Create new suggestion
- `/sustainability-manager/plastic-suggestions/edit/:id` - Edit existing suggestion

---

### Step 2: Add Navigation Link

In your navigation component (Sidebar/Navbar), add a link for Sustainability Managers:

```javascript
{user.role === 'sustainability_manager' || user.role === 'admin' ? (
  <Link to="/sustainability-manager">
    <FaLeaf /> Plastic Management
  </Link>
) : null}
```

---

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies (if not already installed)

```powershell
cd "e:\USER\Desktop\Waste Management System\frontend"
npm install react-icons react-toastify zustand
```
