# Login/Signup Issues - FIXED ✅

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ❌ CORS Configuration Issue
**Problem:** Backend was only allowing requests from `http://localhost:3000`, but frontend was running on `http://localhost:3001`

**Solution:** Updated CORS configuration in `backend/server.js` to accept both ports:
```javascript
cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:3001'],
  credentials: true
})
```

### 2. ❌ Missing Environment Variables
**Problem:** Frontend didn't have a `.env` file with API URL configuration

**Solution:** Created `frontend/.env` with:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

### 3. ❌ No Test Users in Database
**Problem:** Database was empty, no users to log in with

**Solution:** Created test users for all roles (see credentials below)

## ✅ Current Status

Both servers are now running:
- **Backend:** http://localhost:5000 ✅
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3001 ✅

Authentication endpoints tested and working:
- ✅ POST /api/v1/auth/login
- ✅ POST /api/v1/auth/register

## 🔑 Test User Credentials

### Admin User
```

## 📝 Testing Results

### Backend API Test

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@test.com","password":"admin123"}'

# Result: ✅ 200 OK with JWT token
```

### Frontend Test
- ✅ Login page loads at http://localhost:3001/login
