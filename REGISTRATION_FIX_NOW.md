## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### Before Fix:
```
❌ MongoDB connection error: Could not connect to any servers
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
🚀 Server running in development mode on port 5000
📡 API available at http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Is Backend Running?
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health" -UseBasicParsing
```
Should return: `{"status":"success",...}`

### Check 2: Is Frontend Running?
```powershell
cd "e:\USER\Desktop\Waste Management System\frontend"
npm run dev
```
Should show: `Local: http://localhost:3000/`

### Check 3: MongoDB User Permissions
1. MongoDB Atlas → **Database Access**
2. Find user: `sankamaduwantha68_db_user`
3. Make sure role is: **"Read and write to any database"**

### Check 4: Cluster Status
1. MongoDB Atlas → **Database** (Clusters)
2. Check if cluster is **Active** (not Paused)
3. If paused, click **Resume**

## 💡 Why This Error Happens

**MongoDB Atlas Security Feature:**
- MongoDB Atlas blocks connections from unknown IP addresses
- You need to whitelist your IP to allow connections
- `0.0.0.0/0` means "allow from any IP" (good for development)
- In production, you'd only whitelist specific server IPs

---

## 🎉 Expected Result

After following these steps:

1. ✅ Backend connects to MongoDB
2. ✅ Server starts without crashes
3. ✅ Registration form works
4. ✅ User data saved to database
5. ✅ You receive JWT token
6. ✅ Redirected to dashboard

---

## 📞 Your MongoDB Details

From your `.env` file:
```
Connection: mongodb+srv://cluster0.blktod1.mongodb.net
Username: sankamaduwantha68_db_user
Database: (default)
Cluster: Cluster0
```

Everything looks correct! Just need to whitelist IP address.

**Follow the 3 steps above and registration will work!** 🚀
