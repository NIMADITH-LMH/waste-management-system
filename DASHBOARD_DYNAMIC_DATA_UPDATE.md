# Resident Dashboard - Dynamic Data Integration ✅

## Status: COMPLETED

## Overview
Updated the Resident Dashboard to display **real waste tracking data** instead of static dummy values. All sections now dynamically reflect the user's actual waste entries.

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Stats Cards (Top Row) ✅

#### Before (Static):
- Next Collection: "Tomorrow"
- Recycling Rate: "68%"
- Points: "1,250"
- Level: "5"

#### After (Dynamic):
- **Total Entries**: Shows actual number of waste entries (last 30 days)
- **Recycling Rate**: Calculated from actual recyclable + organic waste
- **Points**: Calculated based on recycling performance
  - Formula: `(recyclable + organic) * 10 + entries * 5`
- **Level**: Auto-calculated from points
  - Formula: `points / 250 + 1`

**Features Added:**
- Real-time updates when new data is entered
- Visual feedback (emojis) based on performance
- Actual statistics from database

---

### 2. Waste Collection Insights (Formerly "Upcoming Collections") ✅

#### Before (Static):
- Generic collection dates
- No connection to user data

#### After (Dynamic):
**Shows actual waste breakdown by category:**
- **General Waste**: Amount recorded + percentage of total
- **Recyclables**: Amount recorded + percentage of total
- **Organic Waste**: Amount recorded + percentage of total
- **Hazardous Waste**: Only shown if user has hazardous waste

**Features:**
- Color-coded cards matching waste categories
- Percentage calculations
- Border highlights for visual distinction
- Conditional display (hazardous only if present)
- Empty state message if no data

---

### 3. Environmental Impact Section ✅

#### Before (Static):
- Waste Recycled: "125 kg"
- CO₂ Saved: "250 kg"
- Trees Equivalent: "15"

#### After (Dynamic):
**Real calculations based on user data:**

##### Main Metrics:
1. **Waste Recycled**
   - Formula: `recyclable + organic`
   - Shows percentage of total waste
   - Gradient green background

2. **CO₂ Saved**
   - Formula: `(recyclable + organic) * 2 kg`
   - Based on recycling carbon offset estimates
   - Gradient blue background

3. **Trees Equivalent**
   - Formula: `CO₂ saved / 21 kg (annual tree absorption)`
   - Shows equivalent environmental impact
   - Gradient teal background

##### Waste Category Breakdown:
- **General**: Shows kg amount
- **Recyclable**: Shows kg amount (green)
- **Organic**: Shows kg amount (yellow)
- **Hazardous**: Shows kg amount (red)

**Features Added:**
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Detailed breakdown grid
- Real-time calculations
- Educational information

---

### 4. Daily Waste Tracking Card ✅

**Already Dynamic** (unchanged):
- Total Waste (30 days)
- Recycling Rate
- Daily Average

All using real data from the store.

         ↓
Backend calculates statistics
         ↓
Statistics stored in database
         ↓

## Calculation Formulas

### Points System
```javascript
Points = (recyclable_kg + organic_kg) × 10 + entry_count × 5

Example:
- Recyclable: 10 kg
- Organic: 15 kg
- Entries: 20
= (10 + 15) × 10 + 20 × 5
= 250 + 100
= 350 points
```

### Level System
```javascript
Level = floor(points / 250) + 1

Example:
- 350 points = Level 2
- 500 points = Level 3
- 1250 points = Level 6
```

### CO₂ Savings
```javascript
CO₂_Saved = (recyclable_kg + organic_kg) × 2

Assumptions:
- Recycling 1 kg waste saves ~2 kg CO₂
- Based on environmental studies

Example:
- 25 kg recycled = 50 kg CO₂ saved
```

### Trees Equivalent
```javascript
Trees = round(CO₂_saved / 21)

Assumptions:
- 1 tree absorbs ~21 kg CO₂ per year
- Standard environmental metric

Example:
- 50 kg CO₂ = ~2 trees equivalent
```

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```jsx
const ResidentDashboard = () => {
  // State management
  const { statistics, fetchStatistics, fetchChartData } = useWasteEntryStore()
  
  // Data extraction
  const totalWaste = statistics?.totalWaste || 0
  const recyclingRate = statistics?.recyclingRate || 0
  const breakdown = statistics?.breakdown || {...}
  const entryCount = statistics?.entryCount || 0
  
  // Calculation functions
  const calculatePoints = () => {...}
  const calculateLevel = () => {...}
  const calculateCO2Saved = () => {...}
  const calculateTreesEquivalent = () => {...}
  
  // Render with real data
}
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
statistics: {
  totalWaste: 45.5,        // kg
  recyclingRate: 55.5,     // %
  averagePerDay: 1.52,     // kg/day
  entryCount: 30,          // number of entries
  breakdown: {
    general: 15.0,         // kg
    recyclable: 12.5,      // kg
    organic: 15.0,         // kg
    hazardous: 3.0         // kg
  },
  period: "Last 30 days"
}
```
