## 🧪 Testing the Backend

### **Using Thunder Client / Postman**

#### 1. Get Available Slots
```http
GET http://localhost:5000/api/v1/appointments/availability?date=2025-10-20
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "date": "2025-10-20",
    "zone": "zone_id",
    "slots": [
      {
        "start": "09:00",
        "end": "10:00",
        "capacity": 10,
        "booked": 3,
        "available": 7,
        "isAvailable": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Book Appointment
```http
POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/appointments
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "appointmentDate": "2025-10-20",
  "timeSlot": {
    "start": "09:00",
    "end": "10:00"
  },

- ✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one clear purpose
- ✅ **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modification
- ✅ **Liskov Substitution**: Proper inheritance patterns
- ✅ **Interface Segregation**: Focused, cohesive interfaces
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions

### **Design Patterns Used**
- ✅ **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- ✅ **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separation
- ✅ **Singleton Pattern**: Service instances
- ✅ **Factory Pattern**: Appointment creation
- ✅ **Strategy Pattern**: Notification methods (ready for integration)

### **Code Quality**

## 🚀 Quick Start: Frontend MVP

To get a working UI quickly, implement these 3 files:

### 1. **Appointment Store** (`frontend/src/store/appointmentStore.js`)
```javascript
import { create } from 'zustand';
import api from '../services/api';

const useAppointmentStore = create((set) => ({
  appointments: [],
  availableSlots: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  
  fetchAvailability: async (date) => {
    set({ loading: true });
    try {
      const { data } = await api.get(`/appointments/availability?date=${date}`);
      set({ availableSlots: data.data.slots, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
    }
  },
  
  bookAppointment: async (appointmentData) => {
    set({ loading: true });
    try {
      const { data } = await api.post('/appointments', appointmentData);
      set(state => ({
        appointments: [data.data.appointment, ...state.appointments],
        loading: false
      }));
      return data.data.appointment;
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
      throw error;
    }
  },
  
  fetchMyAppointments: async () => {
    set({ loading: true });
    try {
      const { data } = await api.get('/appointments/my-appointments');
      set({ appointments: data.data.appointments, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message, loading: false });
    }
  },
}));

export default useAppointmentStore;
```

### 2. **Simple Booking Component** (`frontend/src/components/appointments/AppointmentBookingSection.jsx`)
See the `APPOINTMENT_QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for the full component code.

### 3. **Add to Dashboard** (`frontend/src/pages/resident/Dashboard.jsx`)
```javascript
import AppointmentBookingSection from '../../components/appointments/AppointmentBookingSection';

// In JSX, add after Report Generator:
<AppointmentBookingSection />
```
